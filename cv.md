# Lustina Natalia #

__What I can do:__
 * Create an adaptive landing page, make interactive elements: HTML, CSS, still basic JavaScript.
 * Work in multitasking mode. It is even more comfortable to conduct several tasks in parallel, it is very often useful to distract yourself- switch the brain,
then the problem is solved easier and faster.
 * Quickly assess the amount of work, make a plan and route that will allow optimal use of time and effort to get the best result.
 * To correct the texts- I can't stand mistakes, I always notice all the irregularities of the presentation and spree punctuation marks.
 * I can evaluate and offer to fix / fix an inconvenient interface, headlines and content that are crooked in meaning and appearance, and the usability of the site, in my opinion, is the most important moment of both sales and communication.
 * Write a review, an article, a slogan, keywords, other content,
rewrite existing ones. 
 * Find and take the main thing from the information, documentation.

>__I want to practice, communicate, improve.__
